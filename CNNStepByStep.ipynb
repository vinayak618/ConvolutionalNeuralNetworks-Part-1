    "- It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the \"same\" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer. \n",

If you wish however, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like. \n",

Similarly, in convolutional neural networks you can to calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are not trivial and we did not derive them in lecture, but we briefly presented them below.\n",

Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. \n",
